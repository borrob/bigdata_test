============

A first go at big data: using a naive density estimator and a Bayes classifiers

Theory
------
There are some really great tutorials (actually lecture notes) by Andrew Moore. You can find them on his [website](http://www.autonlab.org/tutorials/)

Data
----
There is a useful set repository with data sets, provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository. You can find it [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.html).

Technology
----------
I'm using PostGreSQL the manage the data. It all runs pretty fine on my BeagleBone Black.
